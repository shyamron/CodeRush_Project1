                        the Arab world Tuesday after Saudi Arabia’s shocking World Cup win
                        over Argentina.From Syria and Jordan to Gaza and Qatar — host of this year’s World Cup — fans
                        basked in Saudi Arabia’s achievement, one of the biggest upsets in the tournament’s history.

                        Immediately after their team’s 2-1 come-from-behind victory, Saudi fans
                        who witnessed the match in person flooded the streets outside Lusail Stadium
                        waving their country’s green and white
                        flags while chanting and singing — and even hugging distraught Argentina fans.“I’m speechless,”
                        Saudi Arabia fan Sultan Alharthi said. “I can’t even explain how much happy I am, because
                        I didn’t expect we will win.

                        Qatar’s ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, attended the match, and at one point
                        wrapped a Saudi flag over his shoulders.
                        The moment, captured in online video and widely shared, would have been unthinkable nearly two
                        years ago when Saudi Arabia and three other Arab
                        nations boycotted Qatar over a political dispute.

                        In northwestern Syria, the war-torn country’s rebel stronghold, residents gathered at cafes
                        cheered and celebrated after the final whistle.
                        It was a pleasant change for the enclave, where millions suffer from frequent airstrikes and
                        poverty.

                        In the city of Idlib, Ahmad Al-Absi said Saudi Arabia’s victory was a much
                        needed morale boost for Syrians and Arabs across the Middle East, even if it meant seeing his
                        favorite soccer team lose.
                        “It shows that we have talented people who can achieve things on a global stage,” Al-Absi, an
                        Argentina fan, told The Associated Press. “We’re dreaming of better futures as Arabs, and this
                        morale boosts reminds us that nothing is impossible.”

                        In the streets of Amman, Jordan, dozens of Saudi nationals and Jordanians celebrated in the
                        streets, carrying Saudi flags or placing them on their cars and blaring their horns.


                    </td>

                    <td style="width:50%"> “They stand with us politically and socially, so these celebrations are sort
                        of reciprocation,” said Gaza resident Abu Khalil.
                        “It shows that we have talented people who can achieve things on a global stage,” Al-Absi, an
                        Argentina fan, told The Associated Press. “We’re dreaming of better futures as Arabs, and this
                        morale boosts reminds us that nothing is impossible.”

                        streets, carrying Saudi flags or placing them on their cars and blaring their horns.

                        And in Gaza, Palestinian residents rejoiced, saying they stood with Saudi Arabia in its moment
                        of soccer glory. “They stand with us politically and socially, so these celebrations are sort of
                        reciprocation,” said Gaza resident Abu Khalil.

                        In Saudi Arabia, King Salman announced a snap public holiday for all workers and students in the
                        kingdom in celebration of the win.

                        People watching the match at a fan zone in the capital, Riyadh, jumped with joy and cheered as
                        the game ended. Drivers honked their horns in celebration. Saudi authorities also allowed free
                        entry to a state-sponsored sports and entertainment festival.

                        The gravity of the victory will eventually sink in. Saudi Arabia is a team that had only ever
                        won three World Cup matches in its history prior to Tuesday’s game. Argentina, which won the
                        World Cup in 1978 and 1986, is — or was — one of the favorites this year.

                        “One for the books,” Saudi Arabia coach Hervé Renard said. “Sometimes things are completely
                        crazy.”

                        Saudi goalkeeper Mohammed Alowais, who made two key saves late in the game, was almost subdued
                        at the end, perhaps not grasping the magnitude of the upset.

                        “I am very happy about this result that we have been able to obtain against this very storied
                        team,” Alowais said solemnly. “We have prepared ourselves. We were 100 percent ready and
                        hopefully we will have better results in the future.”</td>

                Arab people do not eat pork, many carnivorous animals, and sea animals without scales. Alcohol is one of
                the primary bans in most of the Arabic countries.
                All animals they eat are slaughtered in accordance with the Islamic rules. Mutton is the most popular
                type of meat. As per the Arabic culinary culture and
                lifestyle, guests are always
                offered snacks, tea, or coffee, and refusing these offers is considered rude since they present their
                friendship and respect together with these.

                Arabic counties range Morocco to North Africa, and from there to the Persian Gulf. This region

                The Middle Easterners are flexible about the time of the meeting, a delay is not perceived
                as a sign of disrespect. In the Arabic culture, greetings are done with men by shaking hands
                according to the order of seniority; and never
                attempt to shake hands with an Arab woman unless she reaches out for it.

                In the Arabic culture, giving gifts is suitable if the meeting takes place at home,
                and the gift must be packed. The packages are not opened in front of the gift giver and the
                gifts offered must not be rejected more than twice for the shake respect.
